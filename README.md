# This is the Scorecard README

Not really sure what goes in here

Here's a list of things I think should go on the wiki

* introduction / application overview
* installation guide
* walkthrough documentation
* application screenshots
* answers to frequently asked questions
* how to guide / pointers for building a webapp

Maybe some of this should be repeated here or placed here instead of the wiki
